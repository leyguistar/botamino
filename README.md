# BotAmino

## Description

BotAmino is a bot I developed during quarantine for the social network Amino, a social network of chats aimed at creating communities on various topics. With over 200 commands, this superb project of several months of design and creation can work both in text and voice. 

During quarantine, I stumbled upon a social network called Amino and got engrossed in it. It was fun, but I felt it lacked something. They had inadequate security, leading me to discover the concept of bots, which made Amino much more enjoyable.

Unfortunately, Amino faced several issues, and as it got sold to another company, official support for bots was never provided. Despite being a project with over 100,000 lines of code and a cloud-designed infrastructure, it came to a halt. After much consideration, I decided to release the code to the community and see if they can make good use of it.

## Features

The bot is highly innovative, employing over 20 APIs, a SQL database, music playback in C, video playback, and Youtube integration. It also utilizes reverse engineering to identify the source code keys necessary to connect to the API, creates a structure for a diverse variety of games, and applies AI to identify faces in images and add hats to them.

The bot has a sarcastic and humorous nature, meant purely for entertainment and not to be taken seriously.

## Installation

The step-by-step installation was lost due to the development of the project.

## Usage

As too much time has passed since its creation, I cannot provide a complete description of all the functioning commands; however, fortunately, the help list for them is available in the source code.

## Data Management

This code uses an SQL database for its operation, storing both the chat configuration options and the users, as well as the wife, girlfriend, waifu, achievements system, etc.

## Credits

This project is solely developed by @leyguistar but it wouldn't has been possible if it wasn't for slimakoi who made the original amino lib.

Not yet, maybe later

While the BotAmino project may seem dead now, my dream was always to integrate the bot with NLP. But given the limited time I have now and the project's sheer size, it seems impossible to revive it. Nonetheless, I hope this code can ignite innovative ideas in stellar tech minds out there.

**Note**: The project code weighs 5GB with images and videos, and I still need to figure out a way to share it without damaging important parts. So stay tuned for updates!
